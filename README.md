Create the most basic, simple and valid HTML file called base_index.html

The page should contain:

a DOCTYPE
a head:
with a title
a body
Tips: don’t forget to read all concept pages…

Test the webpage with the official HTML Validator. You will see that it is not happy!

First things first, fix the code in base_index.html so that it is valid.

You will see that the validator then becomes much happier!
