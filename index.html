      Headings are important in structuring your content. They range from level

    <!-- Third paragraph -->
    <p>
      Paragraphs are used to organize text into readable blocks. It helps in
      improving the readability of the webpage. Each paragraph tag
      <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> can contain text, links, or even images, making it
      highly versatile.

    <!-- Fourth paragraph -->
    <p>
      In addition to headings and paragraphs, images can also be added to a
      webpage. Images can be made clickable, allowing them to link to another
      website, providing additional resources or information to the user.
